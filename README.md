# DearPyGUI-Examples
A growing set of example applets that draw support using the [Dear PyGUI](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) API, a Python GUI framework built upon the [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) library in C++.

The goal is to make all examples self-contained in pure python. They should also be fully compatible with the latest releases of the *Dear PyGUI* API.

## Example Usage
Using the examples is easy. Open an example subfolder and run it's corresponding named .py file.

## Installation

**Requirements**
- Python 3.8 64-bit or greater
